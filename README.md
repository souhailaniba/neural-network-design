# neural-network-design

The aim of this project was to design three neural network models based on a dataset derived from a Design of Experiment (DoE) conducted in the LCFC Laboratory. The dataset reflects operator behaviour during assembly tasks in two environments: the real world and virtual reality (VR). The models were built to achieve the following objectives:

1. Classification Model 1: Identify irrelevant postures (biomechanically invalid).
2. Classification Model 2: Predict whether assembly occurred in the real or virtual environment.
3. Regression Model 3: Predict joint angles based on operator and task characteristics.
